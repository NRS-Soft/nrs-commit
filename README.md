# NRS Committer 

A Rust version [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen).
This is a fork of [commit-formatter](https://github.com/Eliot00/commit-formatter)

## Usage

If you have `Cargo`, just run `cargo install nrs-commit` to install the binary package.

If you get a error: 'command not found: nrs-commit', maybe you need to add cargo installation directory to PATH.
